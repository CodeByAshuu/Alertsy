Alertsy is an intelligent chatbot designed to help users track and get notified about exclusive product drops. Whether you're after the latest sneakers, rare streetwear, gadgets, or luxury goods — Alertsy makes sure you never miss a drop.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To provide users with an AI-powered assistant that tracks brand-specific and category-based product drops, and notifies them in real time — making the hunt for limited-edition items effortless.

---

## ❓ Problem It Solves

- Users often miss exclusive releases due to lack of real-time alerts.
- Manual tracking of multiple brands and stores is frustrating and time-consuming.
- Most tools are complex or require too much setup.

**Alertsy** solves this by:
- Letting users interact naturally with a chatbot.
- Tracking specific brands or product types on request.
- Sending real-time notifications when tracked items are available.
- Supporting various product categories like sneakers, watches, phones, and more.

## 💡 How It Works

1. Users log in via a secure login form.
2. They tell the chatbot what they want to track (e.g., *"Track Supreme T-shirts"*).
3. The AI responds and sets up tracking with confirmation.
4. When a drop is detected, the user receives an alert (notification system).
5. All in an aesthetic dark/light themed UI.
